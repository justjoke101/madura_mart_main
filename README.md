## Default Credentials

After running the database seeders, you can access the system using the master owner account:

- **Email**: `admin@linux.com`
- **Password**: `password`

*(Other dummy accounts for couriers and customers are auto-generated with the password `password` if you wish to test different role views).*

## Core Database Architecture

The system revolves around these primary operational flows:

1. **Procurement Flow**: `Distributors` -> `Purchases` -> `Purchase Details` -> `Products` (Increases Stock)
2. **Sales Flow (POS)**: `Sales` -> `Sale Details` -> `Products` (Decreases Stock)
3. **Logistics Flow**: `Orders` -> `Deliveries` -> `Expeditions / Couriers`
